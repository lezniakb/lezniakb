## About Me
I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for penetration testing and red teaming. Currently dedicated to enhancing my skills through continuous learning and practical challenges. As I go through the challanges, I also like visiting Blue Team rooms to gain a more comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity as a whole.

Since 2024, I've been actively participating in courses and challenges on TryHackMe, where I've reached the **top 1% of users** on the platform.

## Tech Interests
1. **Cybersecurity:** Penetration testing, CTF challenges, vulnerability assessment
2. **Computer Hardware:** Building custom PCs, staying current with hardware trends
3. **AI:** The past, the future, and the now.

## Current Focus
- Advancing my skills through TryHackMe rooms
- Participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions
- Exploring and learning the usage of new security tools
- Expanding knowledge in both offensive and defensive security techniques

## Beyond Tech
When I'm not testing security systems or learning new skills, you can find me:
- Cycling through the city
- Researching the latest published CVEs
- Editing videos and gameplays

## Fun Facts
- I've built three computers from scratch, completely on my own (well, with Youtube guides :D). Each one successfully booted on the first try and passed all tests!
- I always look for opportunities to do something fun, or at least to make something out of this time. One day it's looking for new fun things to do in the city, other time I find myself looking at places I want to visit.
- My favourite game franchise is Yakuza - the story, the graphics, the gameplay - all of it is amazing.
