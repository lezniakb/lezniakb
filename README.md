## About Me
I'm passionate about cybersecurity, especially for pentests and challenges (CTFs). Currently evolving my skills through continous learning (trying to keep the streak alive!) and testing myself in challenges. I also like checking out Blue Team rooms to better understand cybersecurity as a whole. 

Since 2024, I've been actively doing courses and challenges on TryHackMe. I've reached the **top 1% of users** on the platform.

## Tech Interests
Cybersecurity: Penetration testing, CTFs, technical writeups on how soft/hardware works;

AI: The beginnings, where we are now, and what's coming in the future;

Hardware: Building PCs, following current trends and getting excited with new revelations.

## Current Focus
- CTF Team Lead at Dragons Cybersecurity Student Research Group (Lodz University of Technology)
- Advancing my skills through TryHackMe rooms
- Preparing writeups and videos for solved CTF rooms
- Participating in Capture The Flag competitions
- Exploring and learning new security tools
- Expanding knowledge in both offensive and defensive security techniques

## Beyond Tech
When I'm offline, you can find me:
- Cycling through the city
- Reading books (Janusz A. Zajdel, Securitum, Andrzej Sapkowski)
- Editing videos and gameplays

## Fun Facts
- I've built three computers from scratch, completely on my own (well, with Youtube guides ;). Each one successfully booted on the first try and passed all tests!
- I always look for opportunities to do something fun, or at least to make something out of this time. One day I'm looking for new books/movies, other time I'm going out to eat something fancy.
- My favourite game franchise is Yakuza - the story, the graphics, the gameplay - all of it is amazing.
